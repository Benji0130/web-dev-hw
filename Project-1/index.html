  <h3>The Snowbird</h3>

  <pre>
    When all the ground with snow is white,
    The merry snow-bird comes,
    And hops about with great delight
    To find the scattered crumbs.

    How glad he seems to get to eat
    A piece of cake or bread!
    He wears no shoes upon his feet,
    Nor hat upon his head.
